                    <h2>Why is Universal Design Important?</h2>
                    <p>People live with a wide range of capabilities, and there are many reasons people experience varying degrees of disabilities, including auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilties. In the US 13% of people have disabilities. There are 6% of people living with vision impairements, 10% with mobility impairments, 3.6% with hearing impairments, and 15% with learning disabilities. Aditionally, people are living longer in today's world and as such the number of people living with disabilities is increasing.</p>
                
                    <p>Often this influences how people interact with not only digital technology but other environments and products. Additionaly, people living without disabilities or imparements have factors such as diverse preferences, expectations, and more that influence this use, illustrating the importance of considering diversity of functional needs rather than soley diversity of ability. Universal Design benefits everybody.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Benefits of Universal Design</h3>
                    <p>Universal Design benefits people no matter their degree of difficulty when using a product. The following are only some of the benefits Universal Design can promote:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Independent Living:</strong> the level of accessibility and usability of environments influences a person's ability to live on their own. Universal Design can allow people of all abilities to live independently as it incorporates accessibility and inclusivity into every step of the design process.</li>
                        <li><strong>Participation in Society:</strong> The skills needed to navigate the world have become more complex, in large part because of the advances in technology. When people cannot access or do not understand how to use these products or services, in this day and age could mean being excluded from social, financial, work, and other situations. Designing products, environments, and services with Universal Design mitigates this and makes life easier for all individuals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Business Benefits:</strong> When designing for all people there are a variety of benefits to business, including increased market research, enhanced customer satisfaction, and positive public image.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compliance with Legislation and Standards:</strong> Standards and guidlines (such as the W3C) help inform people and companies on how to follow legislation. Designing with Universal Design means following these recommendations and thus promotes compliance.</li>
