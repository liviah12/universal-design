                    <h3> Accessible Design vs. Universal Design </h3>
                    <p>
                        Accessibility means how easily a product can be accessed and used. When people of all capabilities can use the product, the product has good accessibility. Thus accessible design avoids creating barriers and allows the products to be accessible to a wide range of abilities. Accessible Design tends to focus on adhering to a set of regulations or accessibility guidelines and is typically approached at the last minute. <br><br>

                        On the other hand, Universal Design aims to incorporate accessibility, usability, and inclusivity at the start of the design process and throughout the development process. Universal design is inclusive of every ability and context, in order to create designs for the largest number of users. It places the user experience at the forefront of design decisions. Universal design is also known by the terms human-centered design and design for all.

                    <h3> Principles of Universal Design </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Equitable Use:</strong> The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility of Use:</strong> The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Simple, Intuitive Use:</strong> Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.</li>
                        <li><strong>Perceptible Information:</strong> The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tolerance for Error:</strong> The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low Physical Effort:</strong> The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.</li>
                        <li><strong>Size and Space for Approach and Use:</strong> Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Web Standards and W3C</h3>
                    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) aims to standardize protocols and technologies used to build websites. The W3C has published several standards or recommendations in order to do so, however they does not enforce these.
                        The Web Standards Project (also known as WaSP) was a response to browser inconsistencies and the growing number of programming language versions. They advocated for proper use of the W3C standards (they were also the ones to call the W3C documents standards over recommendations).
