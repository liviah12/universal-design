                    The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) is a medium-sized spotted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae">wild cat</a> that reaches 40–50 cm (16–20 in) at the shoulders and weighs between 7 and 15.5 kg (15 and 34 lb) on average. It is native to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States">southwestern United States</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America">Central</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South America</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean">Caribbean</a> islands of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad">Trinidad</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita_Island">Margarita</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_description">scientifically described</a> it in 1758. Two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognized.        </p>
                <p>
                    The ocelot is efficient at climbing, leaping and swimming. It prefers areas close to water sources with dense vegetation cover and high prey availability. It preys on small terrestrial mammals, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo">armadillos</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opossum">opossums</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagomorph">lagomorphs</a>. It is typically active during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight">twilight</a> and at night and tends to be solitary and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)">territorial</a>. Both sexes become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity">sexually mature</a> at around two years of age and can breed throughout the year; peak mating season varies geographically. After a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation">gestation</a> period of two to three months, the female gives birth to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_(zoology)">litter</a> of one to three kittens. They stay with their mother for up to two years, after which they leave to establish their own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_range">home ranges</a>.        </p>
                <p>
                    The ocelot is listed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern">Least Concern</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List">IUCN Red List</a> and is threatened by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction">habitat destruction</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting">hunting</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic">traffic</a> accidents. While its range is very large, various populations are decreasing in many parts of its range.

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>
                    The name "ocelot" comes from the Nahuatl word ōcēlōtl (pronounced [oːˈseːloːt͡ɬ]), which generally refers to the jaguar, rather than the ocelot.[3][4][5] Another possible origin for the name is the Latin ocellatus ("having little eyes" or "marked with eye-like spots"), in reference to the cat's spotted coat.[6]        </p>
                <p>
                    Other vernacular names for the ocelot include cunaguaro (Venezuela), gato onza (Argentina), gato tigre (Panama), heitigrikati (Suriname), jaguatirica, maracaja (Brazil), manigordo (Costa Rica, Panama and Venezuela), mathuntori, ocelote, onsa, pumillo, tiger cat (Belize), tigrecillo (Bolivia) and tigrillo (Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Peru).[2][7]        </p>

                <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
                <p>
                    Felis pardalis was the scientific name proposed for the ocelot by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.[8] The genus Leopardus was proposed by John Edward Gray in 1842 for several spotted cat skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London.[9][10]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several ocelot specimens were described in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, including:[2][11]
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Felis mitis by Frédéric Cuvier in 1824 was a specimen from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.[12]</li>
                    <li>F. chibi-gouazou by Edward Griffith in 1827 was based on earlier descriptions and illustrations.[13]</li>
                    <li>Leopardus griseus by John Edward Gray in 1842 was a spotted cat skin from Central America.[9]</li>
                    <li>F. pseudopardalis by Pierre Boitard in 1845 was an ocelot kept in the Jardin des plantes.[14]</li>
                    <li>F. melanura by Robert Ball in 1844 was a specimen from British Guiana.[15]</li>
                    <li>F. albescens by Jacques Pucheran in 1855 was a specimen from Brownsville, Texas.[16]</li>
                    <li>F. aequatorialis by Edgar Alexander Mearns in 1903 was a skin of an adult female ocelot from Talamanca canton in Costa Rica.[17]</li>
                    <li>F. maripensis and F. sanctaemartae by Joel Asaph Allen in 1904 were skins of two adult female ocelots from Maripa, Venezuela and Santa Marta district in Colombia, respectively.[18]</li>
                    <li>F. pardalis pusaea by Oldfield Thomas in 1914 was an ocelot skin and skull from Guayas Province in coastal Ecuador.[19]</li>
                    <li>F. pardalis nelsoni and F. p. sonoriensis by Edward Alphonso Goldman in 1925 as subspecies of F. pardalis, based on specimens from Manzanillo and the Mayo River region respectively in Mexico.[20]</li>
                    <li>L. pardalis steinbachi by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1941 was a specimen from Buena Vista, Ichilo in Bolivia.[21]</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Subspecies</h3>
                <p>In 1919, Allen reviewed the specimens described until 1914, placed them into the genus Leopardus and recognized nine subspecies as valid taxa based on the colors and spot patterns of skins.[10] In 1941, Pocock reviewed dozens of ocelot skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum and regrouped them to nine different subspecies, also based on their colors and spots.[22] Later authors recognized 10 subspecies as valid.[23][24][11]</p>
                <p>In 1998, results of a mtDNA control region analysis of ocelot samples indicated that four major ocelot groups exist, one each in Central America, northwestern South America, northeastern South America and southern South America south of the Amazon River.[25] A 2010 study of morphological features noted significant differences in the size and color of the Central and South American populations, suggesting they could be separate species.[26] In 2013, a study of craniometric variation and microsatellite diversity in ocelots throughout the range recognized three subspecies: L. p. albescens from the Texas–Mexico border, L. p. pardis from Central America and L. p. pseudopardalis from South America, though L. p. mitis may comprise the ocelot population in the southern part of South America.[27]</p>
                <p>In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group noted that up to four subspecies can be identified, but recognized only two as valid taxa. These two taxa differ in morphological features and are geographically separated by the Andes:[28]</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>L. p. pardalis has a greyish fur. Its range extends from Texas and Arizona to Costa Rica.</li>
                    <li>L. p. mitis has a more yellowish fur and is larger than pardalis. It occurs in South America as far south as northern Argentina.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Phylogeny</h3>
                <p>
                    Results of a phylogenetic study indicate that the Leopardus lineage genetically diverged from the Felidae around 8 million years ago (mya). The ocelot is estimated to have diverged from the margay (Leopardus wieldii) between 2.41 and 1.01 mya. The relationships of the ocelot within the Felidae is considered as follows:[29][30]
