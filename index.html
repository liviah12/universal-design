                <p class ="aboutme">Hi! My name is Olivia Hebert. I am currently a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Creative Technology and Design. Through my courses and schoolwork I have learned C++, HTML/CS, JavaScript, Python, SQL and utilized design tools such as Figma, Adobe suite, and Canva. <br> <br>
            
                    I currently work at MagicSchool AI as an intern where I have worked on a variety of projects including data visualization using SQL and Metabase, designing and developing their website, and utilizing Canva and Adobe on various design projects. My time at MagicSchool, working in a collaborative and passionate environment, has fostered a desire to develop innovative technical solutions that enhance people’s daily lives. MagicSchool is a mission driven organization specializing in AI for teachers and their commitment to improving the lives of teachers is inspiring and has shown me just how life changing technology can be. <br> <br>
                    
                    In addition to utilizing technology to support people I also am interested in the intersection of technology and creativity. I love the more “creative” side of technology such as web development, product design, and user experience and interaction.
                </p>
                <!--                    At my core I am an avid learner and I look forward to forever be learning due to the constantly evolving nature of computer science, technology, and design trends.
