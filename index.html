                    Hello! My name is Olivia Hebert. I am a senior at CU Boulder planning to graduate this semester with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Creative Technology and Design. I actually originally came into CU Boulder as a Theater major but quickly realized I wanted to do something else. I find computer science to offer the perfect blend of creativity and analytics that I was missing in theater and other areas of study. <br> <br>

                    I was born and raised in Denver with my younger sister. In my free time I love reading, hiking, hanging out with friends, and listening to music. I currently have an internship at MagicSchool AI and plan to transition into a full time role after I graduate! I've thoroughly enjoyed this class and semester, and look forward to the new year!
